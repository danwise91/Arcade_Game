## About This Project ##
This project was created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
I followed the best practices to implement OOP styled JavaScript by creating
Player (the boy) and Enemy (the bugs) classes which handle specfic attributes
and methods of each object. Currently this is the basis of the project, however
I would consider adding more onto it to better the gameplay.
